<h1>Character Palette Help</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The <em>Character Palette</em> provides a convenient way to access characters that are not on your keyboard,
		such as accented characters, mathematical symbols, special symbols and punctuation marks.
		You can customise the contents of the applet to suit your requirements.</p>

		<p><em>Character Palette</em> supports the UTF-8 character encoding so you can use
		the palette to display or copy any Unicode character.</p>

		<h3>To show the Character Palette toolbar</h3>
